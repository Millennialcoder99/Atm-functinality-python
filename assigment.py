# Now we will create a display screen of the atm along with a menu that will guide the user on the facilities a user
# can use from the machine.



# firstly, we will declare 3 variables. one for account balance, one for an account number, and one for the pin,
# # and initialize those variables
# pin='2473'
# account_balance=50000
# account_number='123456789'
#
# print('Welcome to Prince_Rupay atm')
# print('''1. Show account balance.
# 2 Cash withdrawal
# 3 Cash deposit
# 4 Pin Change''')
# ch=input('enter your choice:')
# # Now we will code for the 1st option i.e. if the user selects Show Account Balance
# if ch=='1':
#     x=input('enter your pin:')
#     account_blnce(pin,account_balance,x)
#
# # Now we will code for the 2nd option i.e. if the user selects for Cash Withdrawal.
# elif ch=='2':
#     x = input('enter your pin:')
#     cash_withdrawal = int(input('enter the amount you wish to withdraw:'))
#     cash_withdrwl(pin, account_balance, x, cash_withdrawal)
#
# # Now we will code for the 3rd option i.e. if the user selects for Cash Deposit.
# elif ch=='3':
#
#     account_details=input('enter the account details:')
#     cash_deposit(account_details,account_number)
#
#
# #
# # # Now we will code for the 4th option i.e. Pin Change.
# #
# #
# elif ch=='4':
#     x=input('enter your pin:')
#     pin_change(pin, x)
#
#
# # # If the user selects any option other than (1-4)code
# else:
#     print('you have entered wrong option')
